Multiplayer Top-Down Shooter Game
Inspiration:
I loved playing the popular online game survev.io with my friends and wanted to create a similar experience focused on private matches so I could ANNIHILATE my friends faster :)
This is a real-time online multiplayer top-down shooter game built using CSS, HTML5 Canvas, JavaScript, Node.js, and Socket.IO.
